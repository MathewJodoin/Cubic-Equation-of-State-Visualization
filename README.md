# Cubic-Equation-of-State-Visualization
A program to visualize and compare phase stability in 3 component systems using SRK and PR Equations of State

As a part of most Chemical engineering curriculum, students will be introduced to equations of state (EOS).  Equations of state use emperical data to derive equations that can be used to determine physical properties.  These physical properties can then be used to determine phase stability via gibbs free energy minimization.

The most accessible class of EOS's use cubic equations.  A set of constants for each component is determined through experimentation and can be found in many different sources.  This application will use the Soave Redlich Kwong and Peng Robinson EOS to display data.

The program does not set out to re-invent the wheel.  We will use a readily available open source program for the 3-D graphing.  There is a great application available by Github user ericarlo.  It can be found at the following address:

Again, in an effort to focus on the problem at hand, we will also use an open source program to solve cubic equations(kinda important when solving a "Cubic Equation of State"...).  It was written by Alan Kaminsky from RIT.  A quick google search brings it up in multiple places.  It can be found at the following address:

To use the program, just choose your components and click "Update Graph"

Enjoy!!!
